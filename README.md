# formance-operator

This operator is in charge of deploying a full or partial Formance OSS Stack.
It aims to simplify deployment and releases management of different parts of the Formance ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. 
Scripts of this repository are using [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind). You have to install it.

### Running on the cluster
1. Create the cluster:

```sh
task cluster:create
```

2. Deploy required resources:
	
```sh
task resources:install
```

This will automatically install all the required services by the stack :
* ElasticSearch
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL
* RedPanda
* Traefik
* ...
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
task operator:deploy
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
task operator:uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
task operator:undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out

You can install a full stack using the command:
```sh
kubectl apply -f example.yaml
```
